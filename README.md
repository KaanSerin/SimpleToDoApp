# SimpleToDoApp
A simple web application of a to-do app
As an initial step of my web development journey, I followed the web-dev beginner's tradition and made a simple To-Do app.
I utilized HTML, CSS, JS, and JQuery technologies to complete the project.
The app is up and running <a href="https://kaanserin.github.io/SimpleToDoApp/">here</a>

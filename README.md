# SimpleToDoApp
<h2>A simple web application of a to-do app</h3>
<p>As an initial step of my web development journey, I followed the web-dev beginner's tradition and made a simple To-Do app.</p>
<p>I utilized HTML, CSS, JS, and JQuery technologies to complete the project.</p>
<p>The app is designed to be responsive(incorporates many media queries), and mobile friendly</p>
<p>It is up and running <a href="https://kaanserin.github.io/SimpleToDoApp/">here</a></p>

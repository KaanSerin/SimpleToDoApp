# Simple To-Do App
<p>As an initial step of my web development journey, I followed the web-dev beginner's tradition and made a simple To-Do app.</p>
<p>I utilized HTML, CSS(GRIDS), Bootstrap, JS, and JQuery technologies to complete the project.</p>
<p>The app is designed to be responsive(incorporates many media queries), and is mobile friendly.</p>
<p>It is also up and running <a href="https://kaanserin.github.io/SimpleToDoApp/">here</a>.</p>
